:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Purpose

This repository provides a Homebrew tap for installing the
https://github.com/expresslang/eep-releases[Eurostep EXPRESS Parser (Eep)]
on macOS and Linux systems.

Eep is a command-line tool for working with EXPRESS schemas that enables
EXPRESS models to be verified against the published EXPRESS language
(ISO 10303-11:2004 or ISO 10303-11:1994).

== Installation

=== Add the tap

[source,bash]
----
brew tap expresslang/eep
----

=== Install eep

[source,bash]
----
brew install eep
----

=== Verify installation

[source,bash]
----
eep -h
----

=== Update to latest version

[source,bash]
----
brew upgrade eep
----

== Supported Platforms

The formula supports the following platforms:

* macOS (Apple Silicon)
* macOS (Intel)
* Linux (x86-64)
* Linux (ARM64)

The formula automatically detects your platform and installs the appropriate
binary.

== How It Works

=== Automated Updates

This tap is automatically updated when new Eep releases are published:

1. A new release is created in
   https://github.com/expresslang/eep-releases[eep-releases]
2. The release workflow triggers a `repository_dispatch` event to this
   repository
3. The `update-formula.yml` workflow runs `generate-formula.rb` to:
   * Download all platform binaries from the release
   * Calculate SHA256 checksums
   * Update `formula-metadata.json`
   * Generate `Formula/eep.rb` from the ERB template
4. A pull request is created with the updated formula
5. After review and merge, the new version is available via Homebrew

=== Manual Formula Generation

To manually update the formula (for testing or maintenance):

[source,bash]
----
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Generate formula for a specific version
bundle exec ruby generate-formula.rb --version v1.4.45

# Dry run (preview changes without writing files)
bundle exec ruby generate-formula.rb --version v1.4.45 --dry-run
----
